# Version 5.5.0 (31.07.2025)
## Core
- [fea] Added support for `INNER JOIN` (as filters) in `UPDATE`/`DELETE`-queries, including queries with self-joins (`UPDATE ns1 SET v=1 INNER JOIN ns1 ON ns1.idx IN ns1.allowed_ids INNER JOIN ns2 ON ns1.prices = ns2.price_id`)

- [fea] Added support for `JOINs` between null-values
- [fix] Fixed multi-fields sort by `composite` indexes with `tree`-type (i.e. cases with `ORDER BY tree_composite_1, other_filed`)

## Core
