# Version 4.15.0 *beta* (22.04.2024)

## Core
- [fea] Optimized comparators execution logic to avoid excessive runtime checks
- [fea] Rewritten comparators for the composite indexes. New version does not extracts fields from the tuple in the each iteration. Overall performance boost for queries with composite conditions is up to ~40%
- [fea] Added extra column subindex for the `hash`/`tree`-indexes. It requires extra memory, but gives ~20-50%% overall speedup (depending on the indexes selectivity). The column subindex may be disabled with the `dense` index option
- [fea] Optimized general sorting logic for the `hash`/`store`-indexes: now it uses column subindexes if possible for the cache efficiency. In some cases this approach provides up to 45% performance gain for the low-selectivity indexes
- [fea] Added extra column subindex for the `string` `store(-)` indexes. Previosly `store(-)` indexes have used the column for `int`, `int64`, `double`, `uuid` and `bool` types only. The column subindex may be disabled with the `dense` index option
- [fix] Fixed types conversions for non-index fields in the select quieries
