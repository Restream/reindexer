# Reindexer data storage format
 
Internally reindexer is processing documents in special objects, called `Payload`. Documents are stored splitted into 3 parts:

- untyped tuple of non-indexed fields;
- fixed-type struct of indexed fields;
- separate column storage binded to full scan indexes.

# Motivation

Main goal of documents splitting technique - get the best features from SQL, no-SQL and column databases.
The untyped tuple is gives applications capability to store any JSON objects as reindexer documents without data schema migration.
The fixed-type struct of indexed fields allows application and reindexer maintains consistent indexes and primary keys. Furthermore it helps to achieve best performance for full-scan and join queries - their
performance are strongly depends on fields access time. 

Also there are optional column's storage is present. They are binded to full-scan indexes, and can speed up full-scan queries.

# Payload 

Payload is fixed-type struct of indexed fields. Internal Payload API is represented by 3 top level classes: 

- `PayloadValue` is shared copy on write fields structure. Size of structure is equal to sum of fields size + 8 bytes header;
- `PayloafType` is payload structure definition. Contains vector of fields (names, types, sizes, offsets);
- `PayloadIface` is template of payload control interface. Holds pointer to PayloadValue and PayloadType.  There are 2 instantiation: `Payload` - can modify PayloadValue; class `ConstPayload` - read only interface, can't modify PayloadValue.

Payload API is close to usual reflection API and contains methods `Set` and `Get` to manipulating fields
See [payloadiface.h](payloadiface.h) for details.


## PayloadValue structure 

| Field         | RefCount | Cap   | LSN | Field1 | ... | FieldN | Embedded Arrays |
|---------------|----------|-------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Size in bytes | 4        | 4     | 8   | Vary   |     | Vary   | Vary            |


### Data format of fields

Trivial data types like int32, int64, double are stored in their native format. 

| Field         | Int Field | Int64 Field | Double Field | String Field |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Size in bytes | 4         | 8           | 8            | 8            |


Strings are stored as `reindexer::p_string`, which is 8-byte weak pointer to string. Important, that `PayloadValue` itself does not owning string.


### p_string 

`p_string` is pointer wrapper, and uses 60-s and 61-st bits of pointer as string type tag. (It assumes, that x86_64 address space is 2^48 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Virtual_address_space_details)

| Tag | Pointed object                                            |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | c null-terminated string                                  |
| 1   | 4-byte string len header, followed by string's char array |
| 2   | reindexer::key_string                                     |
| 3   | varint len header, followed by string's char array        |


### key_string
`key_string` is immutable string with reference counter and exported header containing `size`-field. String data are *NOT* null-terminated.

| Size in bytes          | Field                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 4                      | alignment / ref_counter                      |
| 4                      | exported string length                       |
| N                      | string data, emplaced right after the header |

Exported header is used for direct payload access from non C++ application (e.g. golang binding to reindexer).

### FloatVector

`FloatVector`/`ConstFloatVector` - are the separete types to store float32-vectors. From implementation standpoint it is a simple `std::unique_ptr<float32[]` and vector's dimension value.

`PayloadValue` itself does not store/own `FloatVector`. It holds `FloatVectorView/ConstFloatVectorView` instead, which are a simple views, implemented as a single uint64 value. This value contains optional 48-bit pointer to the actual vector value and 16-bit dimanesion value.

`FloatVectorView` also have `striped`-state. In this state the view does not points to the actual vector and the only way to get vector's data is to request it from the corresponding index structure by appropriate document ID. The idea is to avoid vector data duplication and at the same time do not break linear index structure.

In cases, when vector's data is requested by some kind of query, real vector values will be copied into `FloatVectorsHolderMap` or `FloatVectorsHolderVector` container and `ConstFloatVectorView` in the `PayloadValue` will be changed to it's unstripped version, pointing to the copied data.

### Embeded arrays in PayloadValue

Arrays are stored as ArrayHeader, which holds 4-byte start offset and 4-byte count of elements in array. 

| Field         | Array Field1<br>Offset+Count | FiendN | Array1<br> Element1 | .. | Array1<br>Element N |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------|------------------|----|------------------|
| Size in bytes | 4+4                       | Vary   | Vary             |    | Vary             |


### Data sample

```c++

struct
{
   int64_t f1 = 5;
   int f2[] = {6,7,8};
   int f3 = 10;
   string f4 = "abc";
}
```

| Field     | Size | Offset | Value        |
|-----------|------|--------|--------------|
| f1        | 8    | 0      | int64_t(5)   |
| f2.offset | 4    | 8      | uint32_t(28) |
| f2.count  | 4    | 12     | int32_t(3)   |
| f3        | 4    | 16     | int32_t(10)  |
| f4        | 8    | 20     | &string(abc) |
| f2[0]     | 4    | 28     | int32_t(6)   |
| f2[1]     | 4    | 32     | int32_t(7)   |
| f2[2]     | 4    | 36     | int32_t(8)   |


## Lifetime and ownership

`PayloadValue` behavior is similar to `std::shared_ptr`. `PayloadValue` increments refcounter on copy, decrements refcounter in destructor and deletes holding structure, if refcounter is 0.
refcounter of `PayloadValue` is thread safe.

`PayloadValue` can be in 3 states:
- *Free*: data struct is not allocated
- *Non Shared*: data struct is exclusively owning by `PayloadValue`
- *Shared*: data struct is shared with other `PayloadValue`

`PayloadValue` does not allow modifications in shared state. Before any modification, code MUST create copy by calling `PayloadValue::Clone ()`.  
`Clone` will check state and if necessary allocates new struct or creates exclusive copy.

`PayloadValue` does not owning it's strings by default. To control ownership of strings there are 2 methods `PayloadIface::AddRefStrings ()` and `PayloadIface::ReleaseStrings ()`. 

*IMPORTANT* `AddRefStrings` and `ReleaseStrings` *is not* works by RAII idiom, so code MUST itself control balance of calls `AddRefStrings` and `ReleaseStrings`. If code forgot to call `ReleaseStrings`, then memory will leak.

There are only 1 copy of `PayloadType` per 1 namespace. It's mutable and threadsafe.

## Untyped tuple storing

Untyped typle of nonidexed fields is stored in `CJSON` format in 1-st field (name "-tuple", type string) of payload.

## Typical usage

```c++


	PayloadType type = ns->payloadType_;
	PayloadValue value  = ns->items_[index];

	// Create control object
	ConstPayload payload(type, value);

	VariantArray keyRefs;

    // Dump all fields to stdout
    for (int i = 0; i < payload.NumFields(); i++) {
		auto &field = payload.Type().Field(i);
		printf("\n%s=", field.Name().c_str());
		for (auto &elem : payload.Get (i,keyRefs)) {
			printf("%s", Variant(elem).toString().c_str());
		}
	}

```
