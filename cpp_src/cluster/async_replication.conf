## Reindexer async replication configuration sample

# Replication role. May be one of
# none - replication is disabled;
# follower - replication as follower;
# leader - replication as leader.
role: leader

# Replication mode. Allows to configure async replication from sync raft-cluster. This option may be set for each target node individually or globally for all the nodes from config.
# Possible values:
# default - async replication from this node is always enabled, if there are any target nodes to replicate on;
# from_sync_leader - async replication will be enabled only when current node is synchronous RAFT-cluster leader (or if this node does not have any sync cluster config)
replication_mode: default

# Application name used by replicator as a login tag
app_name: rx_node

# Node response timeout for online-replication (seconds)
online_updates_timeout_sec: 20

# Node response timeout for wal/force syncs (seconds)
sync_timeout_sec: 60

# Enable network traffic compression

# Force resync on logic error conditions

# Force resync on wrong data hash conditions

# Resync timeout on network errors"
retry_sync_interval_msec: 20000

# Number of data replication threads
sync_threads: 4

# Max number of concurrent force/wal sync's per thread
syncs_per_thread: 2

# Number of coroutines for updates batching (per replica). Higher value here may help to reduce
# networks triparound await time, but will require more RAM
batching_routines_count: 100

# Replication log level on replicator's startup. May be changed either via this config (with replication restart) or via config-action
# (upsert '{ "type":"action", "action": { "command": "set_log_level", "type": "async_replication", "level": "info" } }' into #config-namespace).
# Possible values: none, error, warning, info, trace.
log_level: info

# Maximum number of WAL-records, which may be gained from force-sync.
# Increasing this value may help to avoid force-syncs after leader's switch, hovewer it also increases RAM consumetion during syncs
max_wal_depth_on_force_sync: 1000

# Delay between write operation and replication. Larger values here will leader to higher replication latency and bufferization, but also will provide
# more effective network batching and CPU untilization
# 0 - disables additional delay
