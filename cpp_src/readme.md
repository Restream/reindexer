# Reindexer

**Reindexer** is an embeddable, in-memory, document-oriented database with a high-level Query builder interface.
Reindexer's goal is to provide fast search with complex queries.

Reindexer is compact, fast and it does not have heavy dependencies.
reindexer is up to 5x times faster, than mongodb, and 10x times than elastic search. See [benchmarks section](https://github.com/Restream/reindexer-benchmarks) for details.

# Installation

## Docker image

### Container startup

The simplest way to get reindexer, is pulling & run docker image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/reindexer/reindexer/)

```bash
docker run -p9088:9088 -p6534:6534 -it reindexer/reindexer
```

### Container configuration

While using docker, you may pass reindexer server config options via environment variables:

- `RX_DATABASE` - path to reindexer's storage. Default value is `/db`.
- `RX_CORELOG` - path to core log file (or `none` to disable core logging). Default value is `stdout`.
- `RX_HTTPLOG` - path to http log file (or `none` to disable http logging). Default value is `stdout`.
- `RX_RPCLOG` - path to rpc log file (or `none` to disable rpc logging). Default value is `stdout`.
- `RX_SERVERLOG` - path to server log file (or `none` to disable server logging). Default value is `stdout`.
- `RX_LOGLEVEL` - log level for core logs (may be `info`, `trace`, `warning` or `error`). Default value is `info`.
- `RX_PPROF` - if RX_PPROF is not empty, enables pprof api. Disabled by default.
- `RX_SECURITY` - if RX_SECURITY is not empty, enables authorization. Disabled by default.
- `RX_PROMETHEUS` - if RX_PROMETHEUS is not empty, enables prometheus metrics. Disabled by default.
- `RX_RPC_QR_IDLE_TIMEOUT` - RPC query results idle timeout (in seconds). Default value is 0 (timeout disabled).
- `RX_DISABLE_NS_LEAK` - Disables namespaces memory leak on database destruction (will slow down server's termination).
- `RX_MAX_HTTP_REQ` - allows to configure max HTTP request size (in bytes). Default value is `2097152` (= 2 MB). `0` means 'unlimited'.
- `RX_IVF_OMP_THREADS` - number of threads, which will be used to build IVF index centroids (this option has effect only if docker image uses omp version of `libblas`).
- `RX_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT` - if RX_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT is not empty, sets execution timeout for HTTP read operations in seconds. 0 mean no timeout. Default value is 0.
- `RX_HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT` - if RX_HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT is not empty, sets execution timeout for HTTP write operations in seconds. 0 mean no timeout. Default value is 0 if cluster is disabled and 20 if cluster is enabled.
- `RX_SSL_CERT` - path to ssl-certificate file. If it is not set Reindexer will be launched without TLS support.
- `RX_SSL_KEY` - path to file with ssl private key. If it is not set Reindexer will be launched without TLS support.
- `RX_IVF_OMP_THREADS` - sets number of OpenMP threads, which will be used during `IVF`-index building. Default value is 8.
- `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` - sets number of threads, which will be used during `IVF`-index building by `OpenBLAS` library. Default value is 8.

To run Reindexer with TLS support, both of `RX_SSL_CERT` and `RX_SSL_KEY` must be set. Certificate/key files may be added into container by mounting external directory using `-v` or `--mount` options during container startup:

```bash
docker run -it -p 9088:9088 -p 6534:6534 -p 9089:9089 -p 6535:6535 -v<path_to_ssl_files_on_your_fs>:/cert -e RX_SSL_CERT=/cert/<your_cert>.pem -e RX_SSL_KEY=/cert/<your_key>.pem reindexer/reindexer
```

### Image build

Usually this is not required, but you may also build reindexer's docker image on your own, using this [Dockerfile](#cmd/reindexer_server/contrib/Dockerfile):

```bash
docker build -t my-reindexer-image -f cpp_src/cmd/reindexer_server/contrib/Dockerfile .
```

Build command above must be executed from root project's directory.

brew install reindexer
```

## Windows

Download and install [64 bit](https://repo.reindexer.io/win/64/) or [32 bit](https://repo.reindexer.io/win/32/). `32-bit` version is `HNSW-only` in terms of supported vector indexes subset.

## Installation from sources

### Dependencies

Reindexer's core is written in C++20 and uses LevelDB as the storage backend, so the Cmake, C++20 toolchain and LevelDB must be installed before installing Reindexer. Also, FAISS-based vector indexes (`IVF` in particular) depend on OpenMP and BLAS/LAPACK libraries, but those dependecies are optional - you may build `HNWS-only` version by passing `-DBUILD_ANN_INDEXES=builtin` into `CMake`.

Dependencies can be installed automatically by this script:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/Restream/reindexer/raw/master/dependencies.sh | bash -s
```

### Build & install

The typical steps for building and configuring the reindexer looks like this

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Restream/reindexer
cd reindexer
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
# install to system
sudo make install
```

## Using reindexer server

- Start server

```
sudo service reindexer start
```

- open in web browser http://127.0.0.1:9088/swagger to see reindexer REST API interactive documentation

- open in web browser http://127.0.0.1:9088/face to see reindexer web interface

## HTTP REST API

The simplest way to use reindexer with any program language - is using REST API. The
[complete REST API documentation is here](server/contrib/server.md).
[Or explore interactive version of Reindexer's swagger documentation](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Restream/reindexer/master/cpp_src/server/contrib/server.yml)

## GRPC API

[GRPC](https://grpc.io) is a modern open-source high-performance RPC framework developed at Google that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and it is more efficient (and also easier) to use than HTTP API. Reindexer supports GRPC API since version 3.0.

Reindexer's GRPC API is defined in [reindexer.proto](server/proto/reindexer.proto) file.

To operate with reindexer via GRPC:

1. Build reindexer_server with -DENABLE_GRPC cmake option
2. Run reindexer_server with --grpc flag
3. Build GRPC client from [reindexer.proto](server/proto/reindexer.proto) for your language https://grpc.io/docs/languages/
4. Connect your GRPC client to reindexer server running on port 16534

Pay attention to methods, that have `stream` parameters:

```protobuf
 rpc ModifyItem(stream ModifyItemRequest) returns(stream ErrorResponse) {}
 rpc ExecSql(SqlRequest) returns(stream QueryResultsResponse) {}
 rpc Select(SelectRequest) returns(stream QueryResultsResponse) {}
 rpc Update(UpdateRequest) returns(stream QueryResultsResponse) {}
 rpc Delete(DeleteRequest) returns(stream QueryResultsResponse) {}
 rpc AddTxItem(stream AddTxItemRequest) returns(stream ErrorResponse) {}
```

The concept of streaming is described [here](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#server-streaming-rpc). The best example is a bulk insert operation, which is implemented via `Modify` method with mode = `INSERT`. In HTTP server it is implemented like a raw JSON document, containing all the items together, with GRPC streaming you send every item separately one by one. The second approach seems more convenient, safe, efficient and fast.

## Monitoring

### Prometheus (server-side)

Reindexer has a bunch of prometheus metrics available via http-URL `/metrics` (i.e. `http://localhost:9088/metrics`). This metrics may be enabled by passing `--prometheus` as reindexer_server command line argument or by setting `metrics:prometheus` flag in server yaml-config file. Some metrics also require `perfstats` to be enabled in `profiling`-config

`reindexer_qps_total` - total queries per second for each database, namespace and query type
`reindexer_avg_latency` - average queries latency for each database, namespace and query type
`reindexer_caches_size_bytes`, `reindexer_indexes_size_bytes`, `reindexer_data_size_bytes` - caches, indexes and data size for each namespace
`reindexer_items_count` - items count in each namespace
`reindexer_memory_allocated_bytes` - current amount of dynamically allocated memory according to tcmalloc/jemalloc
`reindexer_rpc_clients_count` - current number of RPC clients for each database
`reindexer_input_traffic_total_bytes`, `reindexer_output_traffic_total_bytes` - total input/output RPC/http traffic for each database
`reindexer_info` - generic reindexer server info (currently it's just a version number)

### Prometheus (client-side, Go)

Go binding for reindexer is using [prometheus/client_golang](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) to collect some metrics (RPS and request's latency) from client's side. Pass `WithPrometheusMetrics()`-option to enable metrics collecting:
```
// Create DB connection for cproto-mode with metrics enabled
db, err := reindexer.NewReindex("cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/testdb", reindex.WithPrometheusMetrics())
// Check status of the created DB instance
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// Register prometheus handle for your HTTP-server to be able to get metrics from the outside
http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
```

All the metrics will be exported into `DefaultRegistry`. Check [this](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/main/prometheus/promauto/auto.go#L57-L85) for basic prometheus usage example.

Both server-side and client-side metrics contain 'latency', however, client-side latency will also count all the time consumed by the binding's queue, network communication (for cproto/ucproto) and deserialization.
So client-side latency may be more relevant for user's applications the server-side latency.

## Maintenance

For maintenance and work with data, stored in reindexer database there are 2 methods available:

- Web interface
- Command line tool

### Web interface

Reindexer server and `builtinserver` binding mode are coming with Web UI out-of-the box. To open web UI just start reindexer server
or application with `builtinserver` mode, and open http://server-ip:9088/face in browser

### Command line tool

To work with database from command line you can use reindexer [command line tool](cmd/reindexer_tool/readme.md)
Command line tool have the following functions

- Backup whole database into text file or console.
- Make queries to database
- Modify documents and DB metadata

Command line tool can run in 2 modes. With server via network, and in server-less mode, directly with storage.

### Dump and restore database

Database creation via reindexer_tool:

```sh
reindexer_tool --dsn cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/mydb --command '\databases create mydb'
```

To dump and restore database in normal way there reindexer command line tool is used

Backup whole database into single backup file:

```sh
reindexer_tool --dsn cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/mydb --command '\dump' --output mydb.rxdump
```

Restore database from backup file:

```sh
reindexer_tool --dsn cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/mydb --filename mydb.rxdump
```

A bit more information about interactions between dump/restore commands and sharded namespaces may be found in [main reindexer_tool readme](cmd/reindexer_tool/readme.md)

### Replication

Reindexer supports master slave replication. To create slave DB the following command can be used:

```sh
reindexer_tool --dsn cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/slavedb --command '\upsert #config {"type":"replication","replication":{"role":"slave","master_dsn":"cproto://127.0.0.1:6534/masterdb","cluster_id":2}}'
```

More details about replication is [here](../replication.md)

### Requests handling modes

Reindexer server supports 2 requests handling modes (those modes may be chosen independently for RPC and HTTP servers):
- "shared" (default);
- "dedicated".

Mode may be set via command line options on server startup:

```sh
reindexer_server --db /tmp/rx --rpc-threading dedicated --http-threading shared
```

In shared mode server creates fixed number of threads to handle connections (one thread per physical CPU core) and all the connection will be distributed between those threads. In this mode requests from different connections may be forced to be executed sequentially.

In dedicated mode server creates one thread per connection. This approach may be inefficient in case of frequent reconnects or large amount of database clients (due to thread creation overhead), however it allows to reach maximum level of concurrency for requests.

## Security

### TLS support

Reindexer hash TLS support for HTTP/1(HTTPS) and CPROTO(RPCS). In order to run Reindexer with TLS support, it is necessary that `openssl` and `libssl` libraries are installed in the system. 
Reindexer will detect those libraries on startup if it was built with openssl support option (by default). Upon successful loading of `libssl` library symbols, a corresponding entry or error information should appear in the log.

Paths to files with ssl-certificate (`ssl_cert`) and ssl private key (`ssl_key`) in `PEM`-format must be specified in `reindexer.conf` in `net`-section:
```yaml
net:
  ssl_cert: <path_to_ssl_cert_file>
  ssl_key:  <path_to_ssl_key_file>
```
Alternatively options `--ssl-cert` and `--ssl-key` may be used when running from CLI.

By default, Reindexer uses port `6535` for `RPCS`-server and `9089` for `HTTPS`-server. Those ports may be reconfigured via `rpcsaddr` and `httpsaddr` options in config file or `CLI`.
Any of the servers (HTTP, HTTPS, RPC, RPCS) may be disabled by passing `none` into corresponding port config.

### Authentication

Reindexer server supports login/password authorization for http(s)/rpc(s) client with different access levels for each user/database. To enable this feature `security` flag should be set in server.yml.
If security option is active Reindexer will try to load users list from `users.yml` or `users.json`(deprecate) found in database path. If users-file was not found the default one
will be created automatically (default login/password are `reindexer`/`reindexer`)

Along with the `MD5` algorithm, the `SHA256`-based `SHA512`-based password hashing algorithm can also be used for authentication. To use them, it is necessary that `openssl` and the `libcrypto` library are installed in the system, which is connected dynamically if the Reindexer is built with the `openssl` support option (by default). 

Upon successful loading of `libcrypto` library symbols, a corresponding entry or error information should appear in the log.

#### MacOS

By default, OpenSSL support is disabled for macOS. To enable support for functions from the OpenSSL-library, you can configure and build a project from source code by explicitly passing the `ENABLE_OPENSSL` option:
```bash
cmake -DENABLE_OPENSSL=On ..
cmake --build . -j6
```

If, when starting the server, you find the Reindexer crash with a warning like
```
"WARNING: reindexer_server is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way"
```
then to solve this problem, it will most likely be enough to set the environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the value of the path where cmake found the OpenSSL-library, for example:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@3/3.3.1/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
and restart the Reindexer.

## Alternative storages

A list of storages, which may be used by reindexer as an alternative for LevelDB.

Storage type may be selected by passing command line option to reindexer_server like this:

```sh
reindexer_server --db /tmp/rx --engine rocksdb
```

Also storage type may be set via server's `config.yml`:

```yaml
storage:
  engine: leveldb
```

To configure storage type for Go bindings either `bindings.ConnectOptions` (for builtin) or `confg.ServerConfig` (for builtin-server) structs may be used.

### RocksDB

Reindexer will try to autodetect RocksDB library and its dependencies at compile time if CMake flag `ENABLE_ROCKSDB` was passed (enabled by default).
If reindexer library was built with rocksdb, it requires Go build tag `rocksdb` in order to link with go-applications and go-bindings.

### Converting storage type for existing database

Storage type may be converted by stopping reindexer_server and passing command line option to reindexer_tool like this:   

```sh
reindexer_tool --dsn builtin:///tmp/rx/dbase_name --convfmt rocksdb --convbackup /tmp/rx_backup/dbase_name
```

After executing this command, the database storage in the directory specified by the `dsn` option (DSN has to be `builtin://`) will be converted to the type specified by `convfmt`.
The new type must differ from the current type, or the command will terminate with an error. Currently, two storage types are supported: `rocksdb` and `leveldb`. The optional `convbackup` argument specifies a directory where the original storage will be backed up, if necessary.

### Data transport formats

Reindexer supports the following data formats to communicate with other applications (mainly via HTTP REST API): JSON, MSGPACK and Protobuf.

## Log rotation

There are no builtin mechanism for automatic log rotation, however `reindexer server` is able to reopen logfiles on `SIGHUP`.
So, your external log manager (it may be even a simple `cron` script) have to move existing log files somewhere and then send `SIGHUP`-signal to the `reindexer server` process to recreate log files.

## Protobuf

Protocol buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

Protocol buffers is one of the output data formats for Reindexer's HTTP REST API.

To start working with Protobuf in Reindexer you need to perform the following steps:

1.  [Set JSON Schema](server/contrib/server.md#set-namespace-schema) for all the Namespaces that you are going to use during the session.
2.  [Get text representation of Protobuf Schema](server/contrib/server.md#get-protobuf-communication-parameters-schema) (\*.proto file) that contains all the communication parameters and descriptions of the Namespaces (set in the previous step). The best practice is to enumerate all the required Namespaces at once (not to regenerate Schema one more time).
3.  Use Protobuf Schema (.proto file text representation) to generate source files to work with communication parameters in your code. In this case you usually need to write Schema data to .proto file and use `protoc` utility to generate source code files (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial#compiling-your-protocol-buffers).

To work with Protobuf as output data format you need to set `format` parameter to `protobuf` value. List of commands that support Protobuf encoding can be found in [Server documentation](server/contrib/server.md).

Example of .proto file generated by Reindexer:

```proto
// Autogenerated by reindexer server - do not edit!
syntax = "proto3";

// Message with document schema from namespace test_ns_1603265619355
message test_ns_1603265619355 {
	sint64 test_3 = 3;
	sint64 test_4 = 4;
	sint64 test_5 = 5;
	sint64 test_2 = 2;
	sint64 test_1 = 1;
}
// Possible item schema variants in QueryResults or in ModifyResults
message ItemsUnion {
	oneof item { test_ns_1603265619355 test_ns_1603265619355 = 6; }
}
// The QueryResults message is schema of http API methods response:
// - GET api/v1/db/:db/namespaces/:ns/items
// - GET/POST api/v1/db/:db/query
// - GET/POST api/v1/db/:db/sqlquery
message QueryResults {
	repeated ItemsUnion items = 1;
	repeated string namespaces = 2;
	bool cache_enabled = 3;
	string explain = 4;
	sint64 total_items = 5;
	sint64 query_total_items = 6;
	message Columns {
		string name = 1;
		double width_percents = 2;
		sint64 max_chars = 3;
		sint64 width_chars = 4;
	}
	repeated Columns columns = 7;
	message AggregationResults {
		double value = 1;
		string type = 2;
		message Facets {
			sint64 count = 1;
			repeated string values = 2;
		}
		repeated Facets facets = 3;
		message Distincts {
			repeated string values = 2;
		}
		repeated Distincts distincts = 4;
		repeated string fields = 5;
	}
	repeated AggregationResults aggregations = 8;
}
// The ModifyResults message is schema of http API methods response:
// - PUT/POST/DELETE api/v1/db/:db/namespaces/:ns/items
message ModifyResults {
	repeated ItemsUnion items = 1;
	sint64 updated = 2;
	bool success = 3;
}
// The ErrorResponse message is schema of http API methods response on error condition
// With non 200 http status code
message ErrorResponse {
	bool success = 1;
	sint64 response_code = 2;
	string description = 3;
}

// The TransactionResponse message is schema of http API methods response:
// - POST api/v1/db/:db/namespaces/:ns/transactions/begin
message TransactionResponse {
	string txID = 1;
}
```

In this example JSON Schema was set for the only one Namespace: test_ns_1603265619355. Pay attention to message `ItemsUnion` described like this:

```proto
message ItemsUnion {
	oneof item { test_ns_1603265619355 test_ns_1603265619355 = 6; }
}
```

In case if JSON Schema was set not only for `test_ns_1603265619355` but for several other namespaces this message should have described all of them.
e.g.

```proto
message ItemsUnion {
	oneof item {
		namespace1 namespace1 = 1;
		namespace2 namespace2 = 2;
		namespace3 namespace3 = 3;
	}
}
```

Field `items` in `QueryResults`

```proto
repeated ItemsUnion items = 1;
```

contains Query execution result set. To get results of an appropriate type (type of requested Namespace) you need to work with `oneof` message, documentation for your language can be found here (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#oneof). In case of Python it looks like this:

```python
for it in queryresults.items:
   item = getattr(it, it.WhichOneof('item'))
```

or like this:

```python
for it in queryresults.items:
   item = getattr(it, self.namespaceName)
```

where both `self.namespaceName` and `it.WhichOneof('item')` represent a name of the requested namespace.

# Optional dependencies

- `Doxygen` package is also required for building a documentation of the project.
- `gtest`,`gbenchmark` for run C++ tests and benchmarks (works for gbenchmark versions 1.7.x)
- `gperftools` for memory and performance profiling
